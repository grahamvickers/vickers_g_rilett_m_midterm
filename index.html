			The Toronto Maple Leafs are the #1 NHL team in the 2018 season. They are the best team because they have the best because of their player and coaching staff. With a mix of smart young player and seasoned veterans they are destined for victory. The leafs also made an impressive pick up in the summer by aquiring John Tavares.
