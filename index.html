	<h3>Why the Lighting are better than Toronto</h3>
	<p>
		Tampa Bay has been more consistent throughout the years, last year they managed to finish the top of the atlantic divison with 113 points and clinching the conference. Even in the last 2 decades the Lighting have won a Stanley Cup while the Leafs keep struggling to make it past the first few rounds and has bad terrible chokes. With the roster that Tampa has right now and the Leafs, Tampa Bay has more of an edge because of playoff experience and most importantly defense which Toronto lacks in.
